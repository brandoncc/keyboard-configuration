## Kinesis Advantage 2

### Usage

- Power-User Mode must be turned on (hold pgm+shift+esc, esc must be pressed last).
- Turn on v-drive (press pgm+F1)
- Copy the files into the `active` directory
- Eject the v-drive
- Turn off v-drive the same way you turned it on

### Troubleshooting

If the keyboard loses its configuration, the `active` directory is probably a zero-byte executable all of a sudden. To
resolve this issue, delete the directory and then create a new one. After that, follow the usage directions.
